                Discover a powerful practice for transforming yourself and your reality.
                At age 18, Damien Echols was sentenced to death for a crime he didn’t commit. “I spent my years in prison training to be a true magician,” he recalls. “I used magick—the practice of reshaping reality through our intention and will—to stave off incredible pain, despair, and isolation. But the most amazing feat of all that practice and study was to manifest my freedom.” With High Magick, this bestselling author shares his first teaching book on the powerful spiritual techniques that helped him survive and transcend his ordeal on death row.

                Though our culture has consigned “magic” to fiction, stage illusions, or superstitions about dark practices, the magick Damien learned is an ancient Western tradition equal the Eastern practices of Buddhism, Taoism, and yoga in its wisdom and transformative power. Here he brings you an engaging and highly accessible guide for bringing magick into your own life, including:
            </p>    
                <ul>
                    <li>What is High Magick? Damien clears away the stigma and reveals the history and core teachings of this extraordinary art.</li>
                    <li>The Four-Fold Breath—a foundational meditation practice to train your mind and body to channel subtle energies.</li>
                    <li>The Middle Pillar—how to bring divine energy into the central channel of your body for empowerment and healing.</li>
                    <li>The Qabalistic Cross—a centering technique to help you stay balanced and protected regardless of circumstances.</li>
                    <li>The Lesser Rituals of the Pentagram—powerful practices for banishing negative energies and invoking energy to manifest your goals.</li>
                    <li>Working with angelic beings and other spiritual allies to support your practice.</li>
                    <li>Creating thoughtforms to assist you in your ongoing magickal development.</li>
                    <li>Guidance for overcoming your doubts, enhancing your visualization skills, creating talismans, practicing magick ethically, and much more.</li>
                </ul>
                    
            <p class="px-1">
                “Magick is a journey,” writes Damien. “It’s a continuously unfolding path that has no end. You can study and practice magick for the rest of your life and you will still 	never 	learn everything that it has to teach you.” If you’re ready to discover your untapped potential for co-creating your reality with the energy of the divine, then join this 	extraordinary 	teacher to begin your training in High Magick.

                “Angels do not belong to any one single religion, system, or dogma,” teaches Damien Echols. “They are almost pure energy—the very substance the cosmos is made of. They’re also incredibly willing to work with us if asked.” With Angels and Archangels, this bestselling author presents an essential resource for understanding what angels are, how they make themselves available, and magickal practices to invoke their power to transform your life.

                For the magician—or anyone seeking to enlist helping forces on the path of awakening—invoking angels and archangels gives you access to incredible potential for manifestation, healing, and spiritual growth. In this lucid and information-packed guide, Damien shares his unique understanding and experience of magickal practices refined in the crucible of his wrongful death row imprisonment. Here you’ll discover:

                “When working with angels and archangels,” says Damien, “I’ve come to realize that they don’t carry out the tasks we charge them with just because we ask them to—they do it because they perceive the divine within us.” Angels and Archangels is an essential resource for every magickal library, an invitation by one of the most exciting modern teachers of the art to discover the enormous potential waiting for your call.

                An explosive bestseller, Life After Death turned a national spotlight on Damien Echols, who was just eighteen when he was wrongly condemned to death. But one of the most remarkable parts of his story still remained untold. After seeing a documentary about the “West Memphis Three,” Lorri Davis—a New Yorkbased landscape architect—wrote him a letter, beginning a thirteen-year correspondence that witnessed their marriage while Echols was still on death row and culminated in Echols’ release in 2011. Sharing their private letters, Yours for Eternity is a must-read for the legions who followed the case as well as anyone who appreciates an extraordinary love story.

                In 1993, Damien Echols, Jason Baldwin, and Jessie Misskelley, Jr.—who became known as the West Memphis Three—were wrongfully convicted of murder. Deemed the “ringleader,” Echols was sentenced to death. Over the next two decades, the WM3 became a worldwide symbol of wrongful conviction and imprisonment, with thousands of supporters who called for a new trial. In a shocking turn of events, all three men were freed on an Alford plea, an unusual technicality whereby the defendants were released but not vindicated, in August 2011.

                Now Damien Echols shares his story in full—from abuse by prison guards and wardens, to portraits of fellow inmates and deplorable living conditions, to the incredible reserves of patience, spirituality, and perseverance that kept him alive and sane while incarcerated for nearly two decades.

                “[Echols] has written a haunting book, and the story it tells is hardly over. He is living out a sequel that is no less strange and magickal than what he has already been through.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times

                “Somehow, in the depths of his unspeakable nightmare, he found the courage and strength not only to survive, but to grow, to create, to forgive, and to understand. Life After Death is a brilliant, haunting, painful, and uplifting narrative of a hopeless childhood, a wrongful conviction, a brutal incarceration, and the beginning of a new life.”—John Grisham
