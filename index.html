          <span class="fw-bold">Damien Echols</span> was born on December 11, 1974, in West Memphis, Arkansas, USA. He had a difficult childhood, growing up in poverty and facing abuse from his stepfather. Echols was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and spent time in psychiatric hospitals during his teenage years. He became interested in alternative religions and the occult, which led to him being considered a suspect in a high-profile murder case.

          In May 1993, Echols, along with Jessie Misskelley Jr. and Jason Baldwin, were arrested and charged with the murders of 8-year-olds Stevie Branch, Michael Moore, and Christopher Byers. The prosecution claimed that the murders were part of a satanic ritual. Echols was 18 at the time and faced the death penalty if convicted.

          Despite little evidence linking the three teenagers to the crime, they were found guilty in 1994. Echols was sentenced to death, while Misskelley Jr. and Baldwin were given life sentences. The case gained international attention, with many people believing that the teenagers were wrongfully convicted.

          Over the years, the case continued to generate controversy and sparked public outcry. Supporters of the West Memphis Three argued that the convictions were based on flimsy evidence and that the prosecution had failed to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Celebrities, including Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam, Johnny Depp, and Natalie Maines of the Dixie Chicks, were vocal in their support for the West Memphis Three.

          In 2007, DNA testing showed that none of the DNA evidence found at the crime scene matched the DNA of Echols, Misskelley Jr., or Baldwin. This led to the case being reopened, and the West Memphis Three were eventually released in 2011, after spending 18 years in prison. Echols had spent more than a decade on death row.

          Echols and Davis currently reside in New York City, where they continue to speak out about the injustice of the criminal justice system. Echols has become an advocate for the abolition of the death penalty and has spoken at various events and conferences on the topic. He has also worked with the Innocence Project, an organization that seeks to exonerate wrongfully convicted individuals.

        A paragraph of placeholder text. We're using it here to show the use of the clearfix class. We're adding quite a few meaningless phrases here to demonstrate how the columns interact here with the floated image.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        As you can see the paragraphs gracefully wrap around the floated image. Now imagine how this would look with some actual content in here, rather than just this boring placeholder text that goes on and on, but actually conveys no tangible information at. It simply takes up space and should not really be read.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        And yet, here you are, still persevering in reading this placeholder text, hoping for some more insights, or some hidden easter egg of content. A joke, perhaps. Unfortunately, there's none of that here.
